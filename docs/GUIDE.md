# ECE 411: mp_ooo GUIDE

**This document, GUIDE.md, provides some extra resources and tips for
the MP. For strictly the specification and rubric, see
[README.md](../README.md). For more details on out-of-order processors
in general, see [WHAT_IS_AN_OOO.md](WHAT_IS_AN_OOO.md)**

# Synopsys IP
Synopsys have provided a lot of digital IP for us. You can find the
list of them here:

```
$DW/doc/datasheets
```

You are free to use any of the whitelisted IP in your design. To use
them in your design, first, find its actual name in:

```
$DW/sim_ver
```

Say for example, you would like to use `DW_mult_pipe.v` corresponding
to `dw_mult_pipe.pdf` and `DW_div.v` from `dw_div.pdf`, you should put
them in `options.json` as follows:

```
...
"dw_ip" : ["DW_mult_pipe", "DW_div"],
...
```

# Working as a Group
For this assignment, you must work in a group of three people. It will
be your responsibility to work on the assignment as a team Every
member should be knowledgeable about all aspects of your design, so do
not silo responsibilities and expect everything to work when you put
the parts together. Good teams will communicate often and discuss
issues (either with the design/implementation or with teamwork) that
arise in a timely manner.

To aid collaboration, we provide a private Github repository that you
can use to share code within your team and with your TA.

Part of working well as a team is being courteous to the rest of the
team, even when you plan to drop the class. We ask that you let TAs
and the rest of your team know as soon as possible if you plan to drop
ECE 411, so we can reassign other people and minimize the number of
issues later in the semester.

# Mentor TAs

Each group will be assigned a mentor TA. You will have regular
meetings with your mentor TA, so that they know how your project is
doing and any major hurdles you have encountered along the way. You
must meet with your mentor TA at least once every week. Scheduling
these meetings is your responsibility. Check with your mentor TA for
their preferred scheduling method/availability.

In your first meeting with your mentor TA, you will review your paper
design for your basic pipeline and discuss your goals for the
project. Before this meeting, you should have discussed in detail with
your team about what design options you plan to explore. Your mentor
TA may advise against certain options, but you are free to work on
whatever you like. As the project progresses, you may find that your
goals and your design change. This is normal and you are free to take
the project in a direction that interests you. However, you must keep
your mentor TA up to date about any changes you have made or plan to
make.

In order to get the most out of your relationship with your mentor TA,
you should approach the relationship as if your group has been hired
into a company and given the mp_ooo design as a job assignment. A
senior engineer has been assigned to help you stay on schedule and not
get overwhelmed by tool problems or design problems. Do not think of
the TA as an obstacle or hostile party. Do not try to "protect" your
design from the TA by not allowing him or her to see defects or
problem areas (your TA is there to help!). Do not miss appointments or
engage in any other unprofessional conduct. Your mentor TA should be a
consulting member of your team, not an external bureaucrat.

# Resources

Here are some resources to help with your design process:

- [RISC-V ISA
  Manual](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf)
- [HP1] *Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition: The Hardware
  Software Interface* by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy
- [HP2] *Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (6th Ed.)* by
  John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson
- [RISCV-BOOM Documentation](https://docs.boom-core.org/en/latest/) -
  This is a more advanced out-of-order RISC-V processor designed at UC
  Berkeley. You may find some of the documentation useful for
  understanding out-of-order execution.
- [*Processor Microarchitecture: An Implementation
  Perspective*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-01729-2) -
  This book is a good resource for understanding the details of
  processor microarchitecture, including out-of-order execution (both
  Tomasulo's algorithm and explicit renaming). It is available for
  free as part of the *Synthesis Lectures on Computer Architecture*.
- [Alpha
  21264](https://acg.cis.upenn.edu/milom/cis501-Fall09/papers/Alpha21264.pdf) -
  One of the OG out-of-order processors. This used explicit register
  renaming.

# Testing

Throughout the MP, you will need to implement your own
verification. This is extremely important as untested components may
lead to failing the final test code and competition
benchmarks. Remember that in many of your components, such as the
register bypassing unit, the order of the instructions as well as what
operands are used is crucial. You cannot just test that your processor
executes each of the instructions correctly in isolation. You should
try to generate test code to test as many corner cases as you can
think of.

Furthermore, you should test not only correctness, but performance. We
will run a number of test cases on your processor during final grading
where we will confirm your program's output is correct and also
measure it's performance.

# Advice from past students

Below is some advice from past students. Although the project has
changed since then, their advice is still highly applicable.

On starting early:
- "Start early. Have everything that you have implemented also in a
  diagram, updating while you go."
- "START EARLY. take the design submission for next checkpoint during
  TA meetings seriously. it will save you a lot of time. Front-load
  your advanced design work or sufferrrrr"
- "start early and ask your TA for help."
- "Finish 3 days before it's due. You will need those 3 days (at
  least) to debug, which should involve the creation and execution of
  your own tests!"
- "Make the work you do in the early checkpoints bulletproof and it
  will make your life WAY easier in the later stages of MP4."
- "Don't let a passed checkpoint stop you from working ahead. The
  checkpoints aren't exactly a perfect balance of work."

Implementation tips:
- "Don't trust the TA provided hazard test code, just because it works
  doesn't mean your code can handle all data and control hazards."
- "Also, it was very good to test the cache interface with the MP 3
  cache, and test the bigger cache you do (L2 cache, more ways, 8-way
  pseudo LRU) on the MP 2 datapath. This just makes it easier to stay
  out of each other's hair."
- "Run timing analyses along the way so you're not trying to meet the
  100 MHz requirement on the last night."
- "Write your own test code for every case. Check for regressions."
- "Check your sensitivity lists!!"
- "Hook up the debug utilities, shadow memory and RVFI monitor,
  early. It helps so much later."
- "Performance counters might seem unnecessary at first, but they
  totally saved our competition score. Make a lot of them, and use
  them!!"

Possible difficulties: -"Take the paper design seriously, we
eliminated a lot of bugs before we started."
- "Integration is by far the most difficult part of this MP. Just
  because components work on their own does not mean they will work
  together."
- "The hard part about this MP is 1) integrating components of your
  design together and 2) edge cases. Really try to think of all edge
  cases/bugs before you starting coding. Also, be patient when
  debugging."
- "You might think it makes sense to gate the clock in certain
  circumstances. You are almost certainly wrong. Don't gate the
  clock."
- "The TAs might seem nice, but they don't give you very good
  testcode. Make sure to write your own."

On teamwork:
- "Try to split up the work into areas you like -- cache vs datapath,
  etc. You will be in the lab a lot, so you might as well be doing a
  part of the project you enjoy more than other parts"
- "Don't get overwhelmed, it is a lot of work but not as much as it
  seems actually. As long as you start at least a paper design ASAP,
  you should finish each checkpoint with no problems."
- "Come up with a naming convention and stick to it. Don't just name
  signals opcode1, opcode2, etc. For example, prepend every signal for
  a specific stage with a tag to specify where that signal originates
  from (EX_Opcode, MEM\_Opcode)."
- "Label all your components and signals as specific as possible, your
  team will thank you and you will thank yourself when you move into
  the debugging stages!"
- "Learn how to use Github well! It is very difficult to get through
  MP3 without this knowledge."
- "If you put in the work, you'll get results. All the tools you need
  for debugging are at your disposal, nothing is impossible to figure
  out."
- "Split up the work and plan out which parts everyone will work on
  each checkpoint. You can always help each other out, but make sure
  you know who is responsible for each part."
- "You need to be able to read each other's code. Agree on a style
  head of time, and don't rely on others all the time. Not being able
  to read code makes debugging unnecessarily difficult."
